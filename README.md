# Belval Explorer
This project is a React Native mobile application for Android developed in the frame of the "[Esch2022: Capitale de la culture](https://esch2022.lu/en/)" event.

## Features
When the application is launched, random quotes and thoughts from students and teachers are randomly displayed.
Once the users clicks on "Explore" he will be able to discover the Belval campus. Waypoints (point of interests) are displayed all over the map and are splitted into 3 categories (art, culture and science).
The categories can be (un)toggled in the side menu in order to only display waypoints belonging to a specific category.

When the user clicks on a waypoint a small quiz will be displayed about this particular point of interest. After the answer has been given, further information will be displayed.

The application supports dark mode and will switch on the light/dark mode based on the user's phone settings.

## How to run
In order to run our application, please follow the instructions from the [React Native setup documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for your development OS and the Android target OS.
Then, one should only follow the steps described in the "Android development environment" section.

Once the setup has been done please clone this repository, open it in a terminal and run the following commands:<br/> ```npm install``` and ```react-native run-android```.
The application should be launched in an Android Virtual Device.
